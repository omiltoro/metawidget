/**
 * Facet for Swing environments.
 * <p>
 * Facets differ from Stubs in that Stubs override widget creation, whereas Facets are 'decorations'
 * (such as button bars) to be recognized and arranged at the discretion of the Layout.
 * <p>
 * We define separate Facet widgets, as opposed to simply a <code>SwingMetawidget.addFacet</code>
 * method, as this is more amenable to visual UI builders.
